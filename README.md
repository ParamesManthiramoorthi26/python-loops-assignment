## 📊 Temperature Analysis using Python Loops

This project analyzes weekly temperature data using fundamental Python programming concepts.  
It demonstrates how to work with loops, conditional statements, and control flow mechanisms to solve real-world style problems **without relying on built-in helper functions**.

---

### 🎯 Project Objectives

- Practice iterating through lists using `for` loops  
- Perform manual comparisons instead of using `max()` or `min()`  
- Use `continue` to skip unnecessary conditions  
- Use `break` to stop execution when a critical condition occurs  
- Build logical thinking for automation and monitoring scenarios  
- Write clean, structured, and readable Python code

### 🧮 Tasks Implemented

#### ✅ Task 1: Find Maximum and Minimum Temperature
- Iterates through the list to determine the highest and lowest values manually.
- Does **not** use built-in functions.

**Input:**
```python
temperatures = [28, 32, 35, 29, 31, 27, 30]
